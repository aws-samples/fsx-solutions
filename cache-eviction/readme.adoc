=== Overview

This solution helps AWS customers using Amazon FSx for Lustre to automatically manage free capacity on the file system and save on storage costs.

The Cache Eviction solution for Amazon FSx for Lustre is an AWS CloudFormation template that creates AWS resources to monitor free capacity on your FSx file system. If the file system free capacity drops below the configured threshold (low-water-mark), the solution evicts (releases) space consumed by least recently accessed files on the FSx file system. Releasing a file retains the file listing and metadata, but removes the local copy of that file's contents. The contents are read back into the file system on subsequent access.

Amazon FSx for Lustre provides high-performance file systems optimized for fast workload processing. It can support workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA). These workloads commonly require data to be presented using a scalable, high-speed file system interface for data access. Many AWS customers store their datasets and build their data lakes on Amazon S3. Since Amazon FSx for Lustre is deeply integrated with S3, customers can create a new FSx for Lustre file system linked to their S3 bucket in minutes. 

When you create a new ﬁle system linked to S3 data repository,Amazon FSx automatically imports the ﬁle metadata (the name, ownership, timestamp, and permissions) of the objects in your repository. Amazon FSx makes them visible as new ﬁles and directories in the Amazon FSx for Lustre ﬁle system. Amazon FSx transparently copies the content of a file from your repository and loads it into the ﬁle system when your application first accesses the file in FSx. This enables customers to use FSx file system as a fast cache and process data faster using a high-performance, POSIX-complaint, and fully managed file system. 

The datasets in S3 data repository can span from few hundred TB's to several PB's. All of this data needs to be accessible to the high-performance compute instances through the FSx for Lustre file system. Instead of spinning up a very large FSx for Lustre file system that is equivalent to the size of your dataset in S3, customers can create a smaller file system that is large enough to hold the active working dataset and run their processing jobs. After processing is complete, customers can write results back to the linked S3 data repository using the data repository task API, and release space consumed by files that are no longer needed for active processing. 


By deploying a Cache Eviction solution similar to the sample code provided here, customers can automatically manage free capacity on their FSx file system.  When the free capacity threshold is breached, the Cache Eviction Solution evicts files that have not been accessed for N days until the free capacity high-water-mark can be reached. If there are not enough files available to achieve the high-water-mark, all files that have not been accessed for N days will be released and the CloudWatch Alarm will continue to be "In Alarm" state.


=== Understanding file access time updates on Lustre

Lustre will update the atime of files lazily as it is not practical to maintain fully coherent atime updates in a high-performance cluster file system.  

If the data is read from client cache, no network request is sent to Lustre file servers, as the data is in client cache. To optimize the file system performance, Lustre does not send request to update atime on server if it was not needed. However, if the data was not available in client cache, it will request data from the Lustre file servers and update the atime.  If an inode needs to be updated as is the case with writes, the atime is updated.

*Note*: This is a very important behavior to take into consideration while deploying the Cache Eviction Solution. As atime updates are lazy, the Cache Eviction solution may not have the most recent atime for files that have been cached locally on clients. This can lead to some recently accessed files getting evicted FSx. Releasing a file retains the file listing and metadata, but removes the local copy of that file's contents. The contents are read back into the file system on subsequent access.

The FSx file system should be mounted without the noatime on the clients.


=== Environment and architecture

The Amazon FSx for Lustre Cache Eviction solution is an AWS CloudFormation template that must be launched in the same AWS region as the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Please refer to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[Region Table] on the AWS Global Infrastructure site to find the AWS regions where Amazon FSx is available. The CloudFormation template creates a stack comprising of Amazon CloudWatch Alarm, Amazon SNS Topic, Amazon CloudWatch LogGroup and AWS Lambda function. The AWS CloudWatch Alarm monitors the free capacity on the file system based on a low-water-mark specified in the CloudFormation stack input. As the free capacity drops below the low-water-mark for a period of 5 minutes the CloudWatch Alarm triggers a Amazon SNS notification to a Lambda endpoint which invokes the AWS Lambda function. 


The AWS Lambda function performs the following steps and logs status and errors to CloudWatch Logs:

*	Queries the FSx API to identify the DNS name, mount name and subnet for your FSx for Lustre file system.
*	Generates the userdata script for the EC2 instance that will:
	**	Install python3, boto3 boto, multiprocessing_logging packages.
	**	Install the Lustre 2.10 client on the EC2 instance.
	**	Mount the FSx for Lustre file system under /fsx mount path.
	**	Download the python cache eviction script fsx-cache-eviction.py from the S3 bucket to /tmp on the instance.
	**	Execute the cache eviction script and log status and errors to /<FSx mount path>/Cache-Eviction-Logs directory.
**	Invokes the EC2 API to create a new EC2 instance using this user data script. By default an m5.2xlarge instance type is launched. 


The cache eviction script executes the following steps on the temporary EC2 instance that is launched:

*	Scans the user input directory path  or root of the FSx file system to identify all files that have not been accessed in N days. 
*	Validates these least recently accessed files identified in the previous step are in a hsm state suitable for releasing the space. Files in one of these hsm states will be ignored: [" ", "dirty","released","lost","non-release","non-archive"]
*	Identifies the size and access time of these least recently accessed files.
*	Determines space used by these least recently accessed files. If total space used by these files:
		**	Is greater than target free capacity to be released (difference of free capacity high-water-mark and low-water mark), only subset of files required to achieve the desired target free capacity are released.  
		**	Is lower than target free capacity, all files are selected for eviction. The script will log a message if there are not enough files available for release.
*	Initiates a hsm release to release space used by these files.
*	Terminates the EC2 instance and sends a SNS email notification.


The execution of the Lambda function is monitored by CloudWatch. The Lambda function updates the status to the CloudWatch LogGroup created by the stack. The execution of the cache eviction script on the EC2 instance is logged to /<FSx Mount Path>/Cache-Eviction-Logs/.  An email notification is sent with location of the cache eviction log when the script is triggered.

=== Managing the Solution

Once the CloudFormation Stack is successfully deployed, you will need to confirm subscription to Amazon SNS to receive email alerts. 

You should see the following resources in your AWS management console. These resources will include the CloudFormation Stack Name in the resource names:

•	CloudWatch Alarm to monitor Space on your FSx for Lustre file system
•	Lambda function that will be triggered when file system capacity drops below the configured threshold
•	Lambda IAM role
•	EC2 Instance IAM role
•	SNS topic


If you need to adjust or change the threshold value for the CloudWatch Alarm after the stack was deployed, you can do so by going to the CloudWatch console. Select the Alarm -> Click on *Actions* -> *Edit*. Then edit the value under *Define the threshold value.*

Screenshot below shows an example Alarm configured on a FSx file system by the Cache Eviction solution. The low-water-mark for the free capacity is set to 200GB.

image::Alarm.png[]

Screen shot below shows the details of the Alarm

=== Troubleshooting


*Lambda Execution Logs*

You can find the details of the Lambda execution in your CloudWatch logs when the CloudWatch alarm is triggered.  You can check metrics for the Lambda function  by Clicking on *Monitoring* tab under your Lambda Function.

To view the execution logs Go to *Monitoring* -> Click *View logs in CloudWatch*. Next, in the CloudWatch console window, under *Log streams* click on the latest *Log Stream* to view the execution events for the Lambda function.


An example output from a successful Lambda invocation is shown below:

=== Important Considerations and Recommendations
This solution covers managing the Cache Eviction process based on free capacity on your file system using a CloudWatch Alarm. You can customize this solution to run the Cache Eviction process at regular intervals using scheduled CloudWatch Event or incorporate the Cache Eviction process as part of your workflow.

Some key considerations:

•	Customers deploying the solution should POC this solution for their requirements.
•	Test and validate the time taken by the Cache Eviction Process for very large file systems with millions of files. Consider running multiple Cache Eviction tasks at a sub directory level vs the entire file system. 
•	Consider using a larger instance type for large file systems with large amount of data. By default this solution uses m5.2xlarge.


=== Deleting Resources
All AWS resources created using the CloudFormation template can be removed by deleting the CloudFormation stack. Deleting the stack will not delete the FSx for Lustre file system.
