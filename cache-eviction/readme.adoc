=== Overview

The Amazon FSx for Lustre Cache Eviction solution is an AWS CloudFormation template that creates AWS resources to monitor free capacity on your FSx file system and evicts (releases) space consumed by least recently accessed files, if the file system free capacity drops below the configured low-water-mark.

Customers spin-up FSx for Lustre as a fast caching layer for processing large datasets located on Amazon S3. When working with large datasets customers do not need to spin-up a large file system equivalent to the size of their S3 dataset. Customers can create a smaller FSx file system that is ideal for their active workload and deploy the Cache Eviction solution to manage capacity. This can help customers save on FSx file system costs. 

When a new file system is created, FSx creates the meta-data structure for all objects in the linked S3 bucket or prefix. Data is lazy loaded upon first access from S3 bucket or prefix into the FSx file system. The free capacity on the file system will decrease as objects are read from linked S3 bucket,  new files written or existing files are modified. The cache eviction solution attempts evict sufficient number of files that have not been accessed for N days until the free capacity high-water-mark can be reached. If there are not enough files available to achieve the high-water-mark, all files that have not been accessed for N days will be released and the CloudWatch Alarm will continue to be "In Alarm" state.



=== Understanding file access time updates on Lustre

Lustre will update the atime of files lazily as it is not practical to maintain fully coherent atime updates in a high-performance cluster file system.  

If the data is read from client cache, no network request is sent to Lustre file servers, as the data is in client cache. To optimize the filesystem performance, Lustre does not send request to update atime on server if it was not needed. However, if the data was not available in client cache, it will request data from the Lustre file servers and update the atime.  If an inode needs to be updated as is the case with writes, the atime is updated.

*Note*: This is a very important behavior to take into consideration while deploying the Cache Eviction Solution. As atime updates are lazy, the Cache Eviction solution may not have the most recent atime for files that have been cached locally on clients. This can lead to some recently acessed files getting evicted FSx. The metadata is still present on FSx and data will be read back from linked S3 bucket or prefix upon next access.


=== Environment and architecture

The Amazon FSx for Lustre Cache Eviction solution is an AWS CloudFormation template that must be launched in the same AWS region as the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Please refer to the Region table link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[Region Table] on the AWS Global Infrastructure site to find the AWS regions where Amazon FSx is available. The CloudFormation template creates a stack comprising of Amazon CloudWatch Alarm, Amazon SNS Topic, Amazon CloudWatch LogGroup and AWS Lambda function. The AWS CloudWatch Alarm monitors the free capacity on the file system based on a low-water-mark specified in the CloudFormation stack input. As the free capacity drops below the low-water-mark for a period of 5 minutes the CloudWatch Alarm triggers a Amazon SNS notifiction to a Lambda endpoint which invokes the AWS Lambda function. 


The AWS Lambda function performs the following steps and logs status and errors to CloudWatch Logs:

•	Queries the FSx API to identify the DNS name, mount name and subnet for your FSx for Lustre file system.
•	Generates the userdata script for the EC2 instance that will:
	•	Install python3, boto3 boto, multiprocessing_logging packages.
	•	Install the lustre 2.10 client on the EC2 instance.
	•	Mount the FSx for Lustre file system under /fsx mount path.
	•	Download the python cache eviction script fsx-cache-eviction.py from the S3 bucket to /tmp on the instance.
	•	Execute the cache eviction script and log status and errors to /<FSx mount path>/Cache-Eviction-Logs directory.
•	Invokves the EC2 API to create a new EC2 instance using this user data script. By default an m5.2xlarge instance type is launched. 


The cache eviction script executes the following steps on the temporary EC2 instance that is launched:

•	Scans the user input directory path  or root of the FSx file system to identify all files that have not been accessed in N days. 
•	Validates these least recently accessed files identified in the previous step are in a hsm state suitable for releasing the space. Files in one of these hsm states will be ignored: [" ", "dirty","released","lost","non-release","non-archive"]
•	Identifies the size and access time of these least recently accessed files.
•	Determines space used by these least recently accessed files. If total space used by these files:
		•	Is greater than target free capacity to be released (difference of free capacity high-water-mark and low-water mark), only subset of files required to achieve the desired target free capacity are released.  
		•	Is lower than target free capacity, all files are selected for eviction. The script will log a message if there are not enough files available for release.
•	Initiates a hsm release to release space used by these files.
•	Terminates the EC2 instance and sends a SNS email notification.


The execution of the Lambda function is monitored by CloudWatch. The Lambda function updates the status to the CloudWatch LogGroup created by the stack. The exectuion of the cache eviction script on the EC2 instance is logged to /<FSx Mount Path>/Cache-Eviction-Logs/.  An email notification is sent with location of the cache eviction log when the script is triggered.

=== Resources created

Below is a list of AWS resources created when launching the stack using the CloudFormation template.

•	CloudFormation stack
•	Lambda functions
•	Lambda permissions
•	IAM role
•	CloudWatch Alarm
•	SNS topics

Below is a list of AWS resources created when the CloudWatch Alarm is triggered.

•	m5.2xlarge EC2 instance



=== Prerequisites
An Amazon FSx for Lustre file system created with an optional Amazon S3 data repository must exist prior to launching the AWS CloudFormation template. 

The file system should be mounted on all compute instances without the *noatimo* mount option. A security group for the temporary EC2 instance that allows access to FSx for Lustre file system on port 988.

You can check the deployed resources:

Check the CloudWatch Alarm to monitor Space on your FSx for Lustre file system

Check the AWS Lambda function deployed


=== Troubleshooting


Lambda Execution Logs

You can find the details of the Lambda execution in your CloudWatch logs when the CloudWatch alarm is triggred.  You can check metrics for the Lambda function  by Clicking on Monitoring  tab under your Lambda Function.

To view the execution logs Go to *Monitoring* -> Click *View logs in CloudWatch*. Next, in the CloudWatch console window, under *Log streams* click on the latest Log Stream* to view the execution events for the Lambda function.


An example output from a successful Lambda invocation is shown below:
