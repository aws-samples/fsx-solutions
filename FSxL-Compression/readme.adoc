=== Overview

Pre-requisite:

    sudo python3 -m pip install pyyaml

Because FSx Lustre file system is transactional, file system attribute changes like
DataCompressionType only applies to new writes. To apply these attributes change to
existing files, use this script to rewrite all Lustre regular files at a given
path via "lfs migrate" command.

Depends on the file system size and the amount of data stored, this script can take
a long time to complete. It is generally recommended to:

* Run this script while normal workloads are paused.
* Run this script in a screen session.
* Use guided divide-and-conquer approach if feasible.
    ** Migrate one directory at a time. This can be achieved by
        specifying the --migrate-path flag followed by the target
        sub-directory name.
    ** Specify a manifest file to list the file paths you would
        like to rewrite. This can be achieved by specifying the
        --manifest-input-path flag followed by your manifest file
        path.

Usage:

  fsx_lustre_migrate_files.py [-h]
                      [--migrate-path MIGRATE_PATH]
                      [--concurrency CONCURRENCY]
                      [--manifest-input-path MANIFEST_INPUT_PATH]
                      [--manifest-output-path MANIFEST_OUTPUT_PATH]

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --migrate-path MIGRATE_PATH
                          Path to directory where files will be rewritten with
                          lfs migrate command. Must be a path under Lustre mount
                          point. Default to be /fsx
    --concurrency CONCURRENCY
                          Number of concurrent threads to issue lfs migrate.
                          Default to be the number of CPU cores.
    --manifest-input-path MANIFEST_INPUT_PATH
                          Optional input path to a manifest file that contains a
                          list of file paths that the script will migrate.
    --manifest-output-path MANIFEST_OUTPUT_PATH
                          Override the path where the script writes the file
                          list under given migrate-path. By default the script
                          writes to a temp file at path
                          /tmp/lfs_migrate_manifest.TIMESTAMP.

=== Examples

* Initial state, FS filled with 111 GiB of umcompressed data across 4 OSTs.

    [ec2-user@ip-10-0-152-182 ~] lfs df -h
    UUID                       bytes        Used   Available Use% Mounted on
    t4xczbmv-MDT0000_UUID      172.1G        6.6M      172.0G   0% /fsx[MDT:0]
    t4xczbmv-OST0000_UUID        1.4T       27.8G        1.4T   2% /fsx[OST:0]

    filesystem_summary:         5.6T      111.0G        5.5T   2% /fsx

* Use AWS FSx CLI or navigate through AWS FSx Console to update DataCompressionType to `LZ4`. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateFileSystem.html[FSx API documentation] for more details. 
* Once your file system is updated, log on a host that is mounted with this file system, run

    [ec2-user@ip-10-0-152-182 ~]$ sudo python3 -m pip install pyyaml
    [ec2-user@ip-10-0-152-182 ~]# sudo python3 fsx_lustre_migrate_files.py --migrate-path /fsx/pfldir

* After the script completes, you should be able to see the physical disk usage on the file system has shrinked due to compression.
