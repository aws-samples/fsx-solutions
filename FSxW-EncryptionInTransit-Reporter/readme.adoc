=== Overview

This solution helps AWS customers using Amazon FSx for Windows to monitor the status of Encryption in Transit setting on FSx file systems. Amazon FSx automatically encrypts data in transit using SMB encryption as you access your file system without the need for you to modify your applications. Encryption of data in transit is supported on file shares that are mapped on a compute instance that supports SMB protocol 3.0 or newer. You can enforce encryption in transit for all connections to your file shares by running the PowerShell command:

		PS> Set-FSxSmbServerConfiguration -RejectUnencryptedAccess $True

You can check if Encryption in Transit is enforced by running the PowerShell command below from the Remote PowerShell Endpoint for each FSx file system:

		PS> Get-FSxSmbServerConfiguration

The Encryption in Transit Status Reporter solution for Amazon FSx for Windows is an AWS CloudFormation template that creates AWS resources and schedule monitoring of Encryption in Transit setting on your FSx file system. The solution identifies FSx for Windows file systems in your AWS Region and validates if the *RejectUnencryptedAccess* setting is set to *True*. The solution generates a report with list of file systems that have this parameter set to *False* and emails the report using Amazon SNS service. This allows you to monitor Encryption in Transit setting across your FSx file systems using a automated mechanism.


=== Environment and architecture

The Encryption in Transit Status Reporter solution for Amazon FSx for Windows is an AWS CloudFormation template that must be launched in the same AWS region as your Amazon FSx for Windows file system. Please refer to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[Region Table] on the AWS Global Infrastructure site to find the AWS regions where Amazon FSx is available. The CloudFormation template creates a stack comprising of Amazon CloudWatch Event, AWS Systems Manager SSM Document, Amazon SNS Topic, Amazon CloudWatch LogGroup and AWS Lambda function. The AWS CloudWatch Event Rule schedules monitoring the Encryption in Transit setting on the file system based on a user defined *cron* schedule expression defined in the CloudFormation input. The CloudWatch Event triggers a AWS Lambda function which emails a report with list of all file systems that have Encryption in Transit setting disabled. 


The AWS Lambda function performs the following steps and logs status and errors to CloudWatch Logs:

*	Queries the FSx API to identify the FSx file system Id, Storage Type and Remote PowerShell Endpoint.
*	Executes the AWS Systems Manager SSM Document from an user defined EC2 instance with an SSM agent installed. This allows the EC2 instance to connect to the Remote PowerShell Endpoint of the FSx file system and executes *Get-FSxSmbServerConfiguration* to validate the Encryption in Transit setting.
*	Gathers the output of the SSM Document and identifies all FSx file systems that have *RejectUnencryptedAccess* set to *False*.
*	Sends a SNS notification email with a report of all FSx file systems that have Encryption in Transit disabled. 


The execution of the Lambda function is monitored by CloudWatch. The Lambda function updates the status to the CloudWatch LogGroup created by the stack. 


The following is a diagram of the architecture.

=== Resources created

Below is a list of AWS resources created when launching the stack using the CloudFormation template.

•	CloudFormation Stack
•	Lambda Function
•	Lambda IAM role
•	SSM Document
•	CloudWatch Event Rule
•	SNS Topic


=== Prerequisites

An EC2 instance that is joined to the same Active Directory domain as your FSx file systems. This EC2 instance will be used to execute the PowerShell commands using the SSM document created by the CloudFormation Stack. The EC2 instance should have a IAM instance profile with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore and AmazonSSMDirectoryServiceAccess managed policies. This allows the EC2 instance to get Active Directory credentials from the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and also permissions to execute PowerShell commands.

Before deploying this solution, create a AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter that will be used to store the user name and password of a member of the of the file system administrators group. In AWS Managed Microsoft AD, that group is AWS Delegated FSx Administrators. In your self-managed Microsoft AD, that group is Domain Admins or the custom group that you specified for administration when you created your file system.


Make sure security group for our FSx file system is configured to allow connections to Remote PowerShell endpoint on port 5985. For full list of all ports that need to be configured with your security group refer link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/limit-access-security-groups.html[FSx Security group ports]

=== CloudFormation template inputs

The CloudFormation template takes the following inputs:
[cols="3,4"]

==== Optional scripts (not needed if launching the stack using the table links above)

You can download the CloudFormation Template and the Lambda deployment package from using the links provided below and customize it to meet your requirements:

The CloudFormation template.

link:https://solution-references.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx/FSxW-EncryptionInTransit-Reporter/FSxw-encryption-in-transit-reporter.yaml>[https://solution-references.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx/FSxW-EncryptionInTransit-Reporter/FSxw-encryption-in-transit-reporter.yaml]

The Lambda function deployment package.

link:https://solution-references.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx/FSxW-EncryptionInTransit-Reporter/fsxw-encryption-in-transit-reporter.zip>[https://solution-references.s3.amazonaws.com/fsx/FSxW-EncryptionInTransit-Reporter/fsxw-encryption-in-transit-reporter.zip]


Copy the Lambda deployment package to a S3 bucket and update the following section in your CloudFormation template. Replace the S3Bucket and S3Key values with your own S3 Bucket and prefix:

      Code:
        S3Bucket: !Sub solution-references-${AWS::Region}
        S3Key: fsx/FSxW-EncryptionInTransit-Reporter/fsxw-encryption-in-transit-reporter.zip

=== Managing the Solution

Once the CloudFormation Stack is successfully deployed, you will need to confirm subscription to Amazon SNS to receive email alerts. 

You should see the following resources in your AWS management console. These resources will include the CloudFormation Stack Name in the resource names:

•	CloudWatch Event with a cron schedule to monitor status of Encryption in Transit on your FSx for Windows file systems
•	Lambda function that will be triggered as per the cron schedule
•	Lambda IAM role
•	Systems Manager SSM Document
•	SNS topic


If you need to adjust or change the cron schedule after the stack was deployed, you can do so by going to the CloudWatch console. Go to *Events* -> *Rules* and Select Rule created by the CloudFormation Template. Next, Click on *Actions* -> *Edit*. Then edit the value under *Cron expression* under *Event Source*.

Screenshot below shows an example CloudWatch Event Rule created by the solution. The cron schedule is set to execute every 10 minutes.

=== Troubleshooting


*Lambda Execution Logs*

You can find the details of the Lambda execution in your CloudWatch logs when the CloudWatch Event is triggered.  You can check metrics for the Lambda function  by Clicking on *Monitoring* tab under your Lambda Function.

To view the execution logs Go to *Monitoring* -> Click *View logs in CloudWatch*. Next, in the CloudWatch console window, under *Log streams* click on the latest *Log Stream* to view the execution events for the Lambda function.


An example output from a successful Lambda invocation is shown below:

=== Important Considerations and Recommendations

•	Customers deploying the solution should POC this solution and make necessary adjustments to cover their requirements.

=== Deleting Resources
All AWS resources created using the CloudFormation template can be removed by deleting the CloudFormation stack. Deleting the stack will not delete the EC2 instance or FSx file systems.

=== Participation

We encourage participation; if you find anything, please submit an issue. However, if you want to help raise the bar, **submit a PR**!
